    "Potassium helps your nerves to function and muscles to contract. It helps your heartbeat stay regular. It also helps move nutrients into cells and waste products out of cells.",
    "Calcium is a mineral most often associated with healthy bones and teeth, although it also plays an important role in blood clotting, helping muscles to contract, and regulating normal heart rhythms and nerve functions",
    "Scandium is used primarily in aluminum-scandium alloys. These alloys can be found in aerospace industry components and for sports equipment such as bicycle frames, fishing rods, golf iron shafts and baseball bats.",
    "Titanium metal connects well with bone, so it has found surgical applications such as in joint replacements, and tooth implants. The largest use of titanium is in the form of titanium oxide. It is extensively used as a pigment in house paint, artists' paint, plastics, enamels and paper.",
    "Vanadium is an important element in the production of steel alloys, for use in aerospace engineering, nuclear reactors, and even aircraft carriers. Vanadium can be utilized in ceramics as a pigment.",
    "Chromium is an essential ingredient in the manufacturing of insulin. Without it, insulin would be unable to regulate the blood sugar levels in the body of someone who has diabetes.",
    "Manganese helps the body form connective tissue, bones, blood clotting factors, and sex hormones. Manganese is also necessary for normal brain and nerve function.",
    "Iron is a key component in the manufacturing of steel, without it we would be unable to build most buildings we see in our day to day lives.  Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body, and myoglobin, a protein that provides oxygen to muscles",
    "Cobalt salts have been used for centuries to produce brilliant blue colors in paint, porcelain, glass, pottery and enamels. Radioactive cobalt-60 is used to treat cancer and, in some countries, to irradiate food to preserve it",
    "Since nickel is such a sturdy and corrosion-resistant material, it is an excellent metal for coin-making. The first coin to include the metal nickel was the one-cent piece Flying Eagle, an American coin made of 12 percent nickel and 88 percent copper.",
    "Most copper is used in electrical equipment such as wiring and motors. This is because it conducts both heat and electricity very well, and can be drawn into wires for electronics.",
    "Zinc plays an important role in the body as it assists in the creation of DNA, growth of cells, building of proteins, healing damaged tissue, and supporting a healthy immune system.",
    "Gallium is mostly used in electronics, It has important uses in Blu-ray technology, mobile phones, blue and green LEDs and pressure sensors for touch switches due to its malleable nature.",
    "The largest use of germanium is in the semiconductor industry.
